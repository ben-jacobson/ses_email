# AWS SES - Simple PHP Wrapper

July 2016 - Ben Jacobson

This is a simple PHP wrapper for Amazon Web Services - Simple Email Service. This particular service is for sending emails from your PHP App, programattically. 

Instructions for use:
1. See AWS documentation on using SES, read this very carefully as it's chock full of useful steps. https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ses/
2. Clone or Pull this repo into your project
3. This code relies on the AWS SDK for PHP - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/getting-started_installation.html. In my code, the SDK is loaded into the same folder as this code.
